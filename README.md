## ext2tools
Various tools that operate on `.img` images of ext2 filesystems, originally written for CSC369 at University of Toronto. Note that `ext2.h` and `ext2_util.c` were provided by Bogdan Simion in CSC369 and are not my code.

### Tools

- `ext2_checker` find and repair inconsistencies
- `ext2_cp` copy a local file to the image
- `ext2_dump` get image contents in human-readable form
- `ext2_ln` create a hard or symbolic link
- `ext2_mkdir` create a directory
- `ext2_restore` restore a deleted file
- `ext2_rm` delete a file
